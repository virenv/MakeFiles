Why to use POM 
1) Same element again and again in every test.
2) Hard to distinguish between different elements with same name for ex : Continue or Next Button
3) Reduce maintenance in case of change in any element property or Page function


e) TC_SN_005 Cart Item : Technique to create Page Object for List of Items in Table or Container 
f) TC_SN_006 Delete Cart Item : Technique to pass above created item to methods

Test NG before/after method usage ToDo list
a) Teach a session on how we can remove the burden of asking for a driver in tests to some before and after test.
b) Show how it can help us close the driver automatically with out explicitly calling the driver.close()/quit() in tests.


Practice  : Convert all the test in to POM pattern


Once they have completed the exercise we will show them how we can return one POM method in another POM
